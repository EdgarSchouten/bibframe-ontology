## What makes a good GitHub Issue for the BF Vocabulary/Ontology?

A good GitHub issue will contain some narrative explanation of the problem and the 
need to address it with a Bibframe ontology change.  It should detail what about the 
current Bibframe vocabulary makes something impossible or not right.   If new classes 
and/or properties are proposed, suggested names should be provided along with a label, 
a definition, and any editorial notes.  If a new property is being proposed, include 
the type of property and any suggested domains and ranges.  If it is a Class, submit 
the type of class and whether it is a subclass of another Class. There should be examples 
showing the outcome of the proposed change, if applicable.   All of the changes that 
might be in play should be bundled under a single GitHub issue and discussed as a 
whole: for example, proposing an inverse to an existing property *and* asking to 
remove the domain/range of the existing property should not be treated as discrete 
requests. Thematically and functionally they are related.
