## What makes a good GitHub Issue for the BF Vocabulary/Ontology?

A good GitHub issue will contain some narrative explanation of the problem and the 
need to address it with a Bibframe ontology change.  It should detail what about the 
current Bibframe vocabulary makes something impossible or not right.   If new classes 
and/or properties are proposed, suggested names should be provided along with a label, 
a definition, and any editorial notes.  If a new property is being proposed, include 
the type of property and any suggested domains and ranges.  If it is a Class, submit 
the type of class and whether it is a subclass of another Class. There should be examples 
showing the outcome of the proposed change, if applicable.   All of the changes that 
might be in play should be bundled under a single GitHub issue and discussed as a 
whole: for example, proposing an inverse to an existing property *and* asking to 
remove the domain/range of the existing property should not be treated as discrete 
requests. Thematically and functionally they are related. 

The ideas in the above stem from the current MARC change process, which, if you are not familiar,
takes the form first of "Discussion Papers" followed by "Proposals," if the discussion paper merits 
advancement.  A sample [Discussion Paper](https://www.loc.gov/marc/mac/2021/2021-dp09.html); a sample 
[Proposal](https://www.loc.gov/marc/mac/2021/2021-10.html).  To be clear, while an Issue that 
rose to the level of MARC Discussion Paper would be welcomed (they do introduce and lay out the issue 
comprehensively and clearly), GitHub issues do not need to be as polished, but the general 
outline - introduction of problem, current state, issues with current state, and solution - 
is essential to a good change process.

## Examples

These examples are not perfect, but they are nevertheless representative of the nature
and tone of what is needed to assess an issue as a community.  One thing to take note of -
specifically the two 'simpler' examples - is that given the nature of the request, sometimes
a short Issue is all that is really needed.
