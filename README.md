# Overview
Initiated by the Library of Congress, BIBFRAME provides a foundation for the future of bibliographic description, both on the web, and in the broader networked world that is grounded in Linked Data techniques. A major focus of the initiative is to determine a transition path for the MARC 21 formats while preserving a robust data exchange that has supported resource sharing and cataloging cost savings in recent decades.

## Model and Vocabulary (2.0)
This repository contains the BIBFRAME 2.0 Vocabulary [bibframe.rdf](bibframe.rdf) and Library of Congress Bibframe local extensions [bflc.rdf](bflc.rdf) and is intended for tracking issues and changes to the vocabulary.
